** Finding players

Once you enter the game, you need to flip the switch near the top of
the screen to connect to the server and start searching for
players. As soon as an opponent is found for you, the game will start
and the HUD at the bottom will indicate which player's turn is active.

** Game Rules

You take turns moving your troops onto the board. The first player to
place 5 units in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

If you are player 0, your troops are on the left side of the board. If
you are player 1, your troops are on the right side. When it is your
turn, click on one of your troops and then click on the part of the
board you would like to move to.

Once a player has 5 in a row, the game will be over. You must reload
the game window to play again.
