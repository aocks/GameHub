* Introduction

The GameHub serves as a way for AOCKS to distribute games and game
related tools and commentary via GitHub pages.

This branch is mainly intended for developers and not so useful to the
general public. We leave it public in case it helps others in setting
up distribution of tools and software via github pages.

The main site is in the gh-pages branch. When updates to that branch
get pushed, GitHub automatically runs a process to build a static site
which gets reflected on https://aocks.github.io/GameHub/.

* Usage

FIXME: need more discussion:

  1. @emin63: see notes in =GameHub= node of =hsrv= repo for some
     work-in-progress notes
  2. FIXME: can commit directly to gh-pages branch.
  3. FIXME: can put stuff in dist directory
     - using =npm run deploy= or directly via =node gh-pages -d dist=
       will push stuff in =dist= directory into gh-pages branch and
       push to github.
